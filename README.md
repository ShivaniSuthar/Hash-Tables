# Hash-Tables-In-Java
## Project Summary:
I programmed a classic hash table in Java. The HashTable file contains the actual implementation of the hash table including methods such as inserting an element, determining if a value is in the hash table, and rehashing the hash table if necessary. The HashTableTest file contains tests to test these methods.

This project utilized class creation, exception handling, and a conceptual understanding of how Hash Tables work. 
 
Testing was done using J-Unit testing.
