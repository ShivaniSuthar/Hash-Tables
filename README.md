# Hash-Tables-In-Java
## Project Summary:
I programmed a classic hash table in Java. The _HashTable file contains the actual implementation of the hash table including methods such as inserting an element, determining if a value is in the hash table, and rehashing the hash table if necessary. The _HashTableTest file contains tests to test these methods.

Knowledge of how hash tables work, class creation, and exception handling were the main concepts applied in this project.
 
Testing was done using J-Unit testing.
